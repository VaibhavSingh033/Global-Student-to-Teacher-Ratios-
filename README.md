"The UNESCO Institute of Statistics collects country-level data on the number of teachers, teacher-to-student ratios, and related figures. You can download the data or explore it in UNESCOâ€™s eAtlas of Teachers or their interactive visualization of teacher supply in Asia"

There is even more education data at the country level available at UNESCO Institute of Statistics.

"Reducing class size to increase student achievement is an approach that has been tried, debated, and analyzed for several decades. The premise seems logical: with fewer students to teach, teachers can coax better performance from each of them. But what does the research show?Some researchers have not found a connection between smaller classes and higher student achievement, but most of the research shows that when class size reduction programs are well-designed and implemented in the primary grades (K-3), student achievement rises as class size drops."
